# LipReaderModel
**Overview**:
This repository contains a deep learning-based project focused on automatic lip reading from videos. The aim is to develop a model capable of recognizing and interpreting spoken words by analyzing lip movements, without relying on audio input. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process visual data and predict spoken words or sentences.
